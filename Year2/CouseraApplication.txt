Dear sir: I am an undergraduate Imperial College London in the Uk and I major in Aeronautical Engineering. My income is barely enough to cover my living expenses, but I don’t have extra money to register for the class. Furthermore, I want to save money for my family, most of my family income is used in my tuition fee. Since I don't want to put more burden on my family, I request Coursera for financial aid, and I promise to finish the course. I think Coursera is a very good platform for people to learn something they need, I registered Coursera about 2 years ago and sincerely hoping to learn something. The financial aid program provided by Coursera is a great opportunity for poor students like me to pursue the course, and I hope I can get the chance. Thank you for your consideration. I hope you can agree to my application. I look forward to your reply.

My teacher and my friend highly recommend me to take this class，this class will help me to improve my learning skills and through this class, I can use my time more effectively.
As the intro said, the data structure and algorithms are always important in computer science
In this course,  I will learn the foundations of different data structures using Java. and I will understand the major technology trends driving most algorithm problems in the world,Be able to using data structures to solve real-world questions, know how to implement methods on the questions on leetcode. As a result, this course will be vital for me as it can help me crack future interview of becoming a software engineer.
In the process of my studying, I realize that my learning method is not not systematic,I always change my way to learn so that my efficient is very low .So I want that this class will help me to improve these circumstances
